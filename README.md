# Intro

This is the repo for the Christmas lights I broke (and then had to re-fix)
 

# History

The short story is that I have these rope lights that are battery powered, and I wanted to power them via DC so they could be turned on/off by schedule.

In the process of converting the lights to DC, I must have fried the IC which controlled the flashing patterns.

So instead, I decided to wire them up to a Raspi Zero W and create my own stim patterns.
